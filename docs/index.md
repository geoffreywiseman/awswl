# AWSWL

A small tool to make it pretty simple to add and remove ip addresses (or CIDR blocks) from an AWS security group. If you have AWS resources on public IPs and you need to control access to those resources (e.g. SSH to an EC2 instance).

This acts like a sort of oversimplified VPN, where you can quickly give yourself SSH access to a project as you move about from network to network.

## Alternatives

In case you're encountering AWSWL without having considered the other options, you might want to consider [the alternatives](alternatives.md) (vpn, session manager, etc).
