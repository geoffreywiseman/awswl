# Contributing

This is a small project that I made to scratch an itch I had, but I'm happy if it's useful to other people, and if you think you can help make this project more useful to you or to others, let's talk?

## Contributions Welcome

This pretty much already does what I needed, but if you need something it doesn't yet do, and if fits in with the idea behind this, then by all means:
- Let me know what you're looking for
- If you know how to implement it, feel free to submit a PR

I'm not making any promises, of course, but if what you're suggesting fits well with `awswl` in concept and/or implementation, then I'll probably be happy to hear from you.
